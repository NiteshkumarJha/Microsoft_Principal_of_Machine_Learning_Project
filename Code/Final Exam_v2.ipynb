The company is particularly interested in analyzing customer data to determine any apparent relationships between demographic features known about the customers and the likelihood of a customer purchasing a bike. Additionally, the analysis should endeavor to determine whether a customer's average monthly spend with the company can be predicted from known customer characteristics.\n","\n","In this project, you must tackle three challenges:\n","\n"," + Challenge 1: Explore the data and gain some insights into Adventure Works customer characteristics and purchasing behavior.\n"," + Challenge 2: Build a
